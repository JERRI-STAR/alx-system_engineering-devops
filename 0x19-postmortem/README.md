Any software system will eventually fail, and that failure can come stem from a wide range of possible factors: bugs, traffic spikes, security issues, hardware failures, natural disasters, human error… Failing is normal and failing is actually a great opportunity to learn and improve. Any great Software Engineer must learn from his/her mistakes to make sure that they won’t happen again. Failing is fine, but failing twice because of the same issue is not.

A postmortem is a tool widely used in the tech industry. After any outage, the team(s) in charge of the system will write a summary that has 2 main goals:

To provide the rest of the company’s employees easy access to information detailing the cause of the outage. Often outages can have a huge impact on a company, so managers and executives have to understand what happened and how it will impact their work.
And to ensure that the root cause(s) of the outage has been discovered and that measures are taken to make sure it will be fixed.



Issue Summary
 On October 15, 2022, at 10:00 AM PST, Amazon's website experienced a 2-hour outage, affecting approximately 20% of our users. The issue was primarily with the homepage and product search functionality, causing slow loading times and occasional errors.

Timeline
10:00 AM PST - Issue detected by our monitoring system, which showed a significant increase in error rates and slow response times.
10:05 AM PST - Engineers were notified and began investigating the issue.
11:00 AM PST - Initial assumption was that the issue was with our CDN (Content Delivery Network), as we saw similar issues in the past.
12:00 PM PST - Engineers ruled out the CDN as the root cause and started investigating our load balancer configuration.
1:00 PM PST - The issue was resolved by updating the load balancer configuration to distribute traffic more evenly across our servers.


Root Cause and Resolution
The root cause of the issue was a misconfiguration in our load balancer, which was causing traffic to be unevenly distributed across our servers. This led to some servers becoming overloaded, causing slow response times and errors. The issue was resolved by updating the load balancer configuration to distribute traffic more evenly across our servers.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
To prevent similar issues in the future, we will:
1.
Implement stricter load balancing rules to ensure that traffic is distributed evenly across our servers.
2.
Conduct regular audits of our load balancer configuration to identify and address any potential issues before they cause downtime.
3.
Improve our monitoring system to provide more granular insights into server performance and identify potential issues earlier.
4.
Implement a more robust CDN failover mechanism to ensure that our website remains accessible even if our primary CDN provider experiences issues
